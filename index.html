                <h2>Hi, I am Caterina Bisiacchi</h2>
                <p>I am a graduate student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and I am currently pursuing my master’s
                    degree in Applied Science, with a major in Leadership Education and a minor in Advertising and
                    Public Relations.
                    Previous to this, I completed my undergraduate studies in Psychological Sciences and Techniques at
                    the University of Trieste in 2023. Following graduation, I decided to embark on a new adventure by
                    moving to Nebraska to pursue my master's degree while also joining the university's swimming and
                    diving team.
                    Looking ahead, I hope to find an internship after graduation to further educate myself in the field
                    of advertising and public relations, thereby contributing to my professional growth. Finally, I
                    intend to return to my home country, Italy, with important knowledge and expertise gained during my
                    time here.
                    While swimming takes up a substantial amount of my time, I also enjoy photography, reading, and
                    sewing. These
                    activities offer a refreshing break from my academic and athletic endeavors.
